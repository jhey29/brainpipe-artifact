## BrainPipe 
This is the manually written or compiled code that both needs to be in one repository for me to host it on Github pages. It is based on [create-wasm-app](https://github.com/rustwasm/create-wasm-app). The actual source for brainpipe is [next door](https://github.com/jhey29/brainpipe).



## License
Licensed under the MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) because `create-wasm-app` is double-licensed "at my option" under this one or the Apache 2.0 license and the Apache 2.0 license is too complicated for free content in my opinion.
